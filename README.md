# Wumpus World AI

## Overview

Welcome to our Wumpus World AI project! This repository contains the code and resources for developing an AI program that navigates and solves the Wumpus World scenario. This project is a collaborative effort by Rakibul Islam (bsse1210@iit.du.ac.bd), Sazzad Hossain (bsse1207@iit.du.ac.bd), and Md. Yasir Arafat Araf (bsse1220@iit.du.ac.bd).

## Description

The Wumpus World is a classic AI problem where an agent must navigate through a cave, avoiding hazards like bottomless pits and a deadly Wumpus while attempting to find gold. Our project involves developing an AI agent that can simulate the navigation of a logical agent in a given environment, utilizing logical representation and inference.

## Features

- Logic-based representation of the environment and knowledge base
- Logical inference using resolution, forward chaining, and backward chaining
- Random and pre-specified environment generation
- Loop detection and avoidance mechanism
- Interactive user interface to visualize agent actions and knowledge base
- Collaboration through a Git repository
